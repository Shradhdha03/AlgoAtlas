### Coding Problem: Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return an array of all the integers in the range `[1, n]` that do not appear in `nums`.

#### Constraints:
- `n` is equal to the length of `nums`.
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

#### Test Cases:

1. Input: `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`
   Output: `[5,6]`
   
2. Input: `nums = [1,1]`
   Output: `[2]`

#### Solution Explanation:

1. **Cyclic Sort Approach**:
   The essence of this method is to place each number at its correct position, i.e., `nums[i]` should be `i+1`.
   - We iterate through the array, and for each number, we find its correct position and swap it.
   - After sorting, we iterate through the array. If the number at the current index doesn’t match the index, it's a missing number.

2. **Sorting Approach**:
   - First, we sort the `nums` array.
   - We then iterate through the sorted array and compare each element with an expected number (starting from 1 and incremented with each iteration). If they don’t match, the expected number is added to the missing numbers list.

3. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - We simply iterate from 1 to `n` and check if each number exists in `nums`. If not, it’s added to the missing numbers list.

#### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Cyclic Sort Approach**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`. Each element is swapped at most once.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding the output array), since we rearrange the elements in the original array in-place.

2. **Sorting Approach**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding the output array).

3. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` as for each number from 1 to `n`, we check if it exists in the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding the output array).

#### Technical Follow-up Questions:

1. **Handling Large Datasets**: How would you modify your solution if `nums` had millions of elements? Can you think of a way to avoid sorting or scanning the entire array multiple times?

2. **Scalability**: Given the constraints, the input array can be as large as `10^5`. Can the solution be optimized to handle even larger datasets?

3. **Memory Optimization**: The current solution uses extra space for the output. Can you solve the problem using `O(1)` additional space (excluding the space required for the output)?

4. **Real-time Applications**: In a real-time application where numbers are continuously added to or removed from the array, how would your solution adapt to find missing numbers efficiently?

5. **Parallel Processing**: How might you leverage parallel processing or distributed computing to expedite the process of finding missing numbers in an extremely large dataset?
