### Article: Solving Non-overlapping Intervals Problem

#### Problem Statement:
In the "Non-overlapping Intervals" problem, you are given an array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`. The task is to find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. It's a common algorithmic challenge that tests your understanding of interval scheduling and greedy algorithms.

#### Constraints:
- There are `1` to `10^5` intervals in the input list.
- Each interval is a pair of integers where the first integer is the start and the second is the end.
- The start and end of each interval are within the range of `-5 * 10^4` to `5 * 10^4`, and the start is strictly less than the end.

#### Test Cases:
1. Input: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`  
   Output: `1`  
   Explanation: Removing interval [1,3] leaves all other intervals non-overlapping.

2. Input: `intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]`  
   Output: `2`  
   Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] intervals to have a list of non-overlapping intervals.

3. Input: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]`  
   Output: `0`  
   Explanation: No intervals need to be removed as they are already non-overlapping.

#### My Solution Explanation:
The solution to this problem involves a greedy algorithm. The first step is to sort the intervals by their end times. This is because, in a sorted list, the earliest end time provides the earliest opportunity for a subsequent interval to start, thus minimizing the chance of overlap. After sorting, we iterate over the intervals and whenever we find an overlap, we increment a count. We keep track of the end time of the last added interval, and if the next interval starts after this end time, there is no overlap. Otherwise, we have an overlap and need to consider removing an interval. The total count of such overlaps is the minimum number of intervals we need to remove.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort the intervals based on their end time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

        # Initialize `end` to negative infinity to make sure the first interval doesn't get removed
        end = float('-inf')
        
        # Initialize `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of intervals we remove
        count = 0

        # Iterate through the sorted intervals
        for s, e in intervals:
            # If the start of the current interval is greater or equal to the end of the last non-overlapping interval,
            # it means there is no overlap, and we update the `end` to the end of the current interval.
            if s >= end:
                end = e
            else:
                # If there is an overlap (the start of the current interval is less than the `end`),
                # increment the `count`, as we need to remove one interval to eliminate the overlap.
                count += 1

        # Return the total number of intervals removed to avoid overlap
        return count

```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` due to the initial sorting of intervals. The subsequent linear scan of the sorted intervals is `O(n)`, making the overall time complexity dominated by the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since no additional space is needed besides the variables for the count and end time.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions:
1. **How would you handle intervals if they are not all loaded in memory due to their large size?**
   - Answer: For handling very large datasets, external sorting algorithms can be used to sort the intervals. Once sorted, a streaming approach could be applied where intervals are processed in chunks that fit in memory.

2. **Can this algorithm be parallelized for better performance on large datasets?**
   - Answer: While the sorting step can be parallelized using algorithms like parallel merge sort, the greedy approach for counting overlaps is inherently sequential because the decision to remove an interval depends on the end time of the previous non-overlapping interval.

3. **How would you adapt your solution if the intervals came as a stream of data?**
   - Answer: For streaming data, you could maintain a dynamic data structure such as a balanced binary search tree to keep the intervals sorted as they arrive, allowing for efficient insertion and overlap checking.

#### Real-world use cases:
- Meeting room scheduling in an office.
- Allocating resources in a computer system to avoid conflicts.
- Scheduling maintenance tasks on shared infrastructure, like railway or airline networks.

#### Powerful Questions:
1. **What assumptions have you made about the intervals, and how would your solution change if these assumptions were altered?**
2. **How might your solution scale with the number of intervals increasing exponentially?**
3. **What could be some alternative strategies to deal with overlaps if removing intervals was not an option?**
4. **How does the distribution of interval lengths affect the performance of your algorithm?**
5. **Can you think of a scenario where this greedy approach would not yield an optimal solution? What characteristics would that scenario have?**
