**Finding the Missing Number: An In-Depth Analysis**

---

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

---

**Constraints:**

1. `n` is equal to the length of `nums`.
2. `1 <= n <= 10^4`
3. `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
4. All the numbers in `nums` are unique.

---

**Test Cases:**

1. **Input:** `nums = [3,0,1]`
   **Output:** `2`
   
2. **Input:** `nums = [0,1]`
   **Output:** `2`

3. **Input:** `nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`
   **Output:** `8`

---

**Solution Explanation:**

Here are several methods to solve it, ranging from direct to more algorithmic solutions:

1. **Mathematical Formula:**
   - **Approach**: Use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) numbers, \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), to calculate the expected sum. Subtract the actual sum of the numbers in the array from the expected sum to find the missing number.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

2. **XOR Approach:**
   - **Approach**: XOR all the numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then XOR with all the numbers in the array. The result is the missing number because XORing a number with itself results in 0.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

3. **Cyclic Sort:**
   - **Approach**: Sort numbers in the array in-place by swapping each number to its correct position. The position where the number doesn’t match the index is the missing number.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

4. **HashSet/HashMap Approach:**
   - **Approach**: Store all numbers from the array in a set or map. Iterate from 0 to \( n \) and check which number doesn’t exist in the set/map.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

5. **Sorting:**
   - **Approach**: Sort the array first. Then iterate through the sorted array to find the first place where the current number doesn’t match its index.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) for in-place sort or \( O(n) \) for non-in-place sort.

6. **Binary Search:**
   - **Approach**: Sort the array and compare the middle element with its index in a binary fashion. Depending on the comparison, search in the right or left half.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

7. **Boolean Array:**
   - **Approach**: Use a boolean array of size \( n+1 \). Iterate through the numbers and mark each number's presence. The index which remains `False` is the missing number.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

8. **Brute Force:**
   - **Approach**: Iterate from 0 to \( n \) and check for the presence of each number in the array.
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \)
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

**Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Cyclic Sort Approach:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate over the array a constant number of times.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We don't use any additional space as we're sorting in-place.

2. **Addition Approach:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate over the array once.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of space.

3. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - For each number, we're checking its existence in the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We don't use any extra space.

**Technical Follow-up Questions:**

1. If the input array was extremely large, how would you optimize the solution further for performance?
  
2. What if there were multiple missing numbers? How would you modify your solution to handle that case?

3. Consider a situation where the input array is streamed to you (you can't access it all at once). How would you determine the missing number then?

4. If there were additional constraints such as the array being read-only or you can't use any extra space, how would your approach change?

5. What other data structures might help in optimizing the solution, especially if we consider the extensions of this problem, like finding duplicates or multiple missing numbers?
