# Climbing Stairs: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Problem Statement:
You're tasked with climbing a staircase with `n` steps. At each step, you can either ascend by 1 or 2 steps. Your challenge is to find out the total number of unique ways to reach the top.

## Constraints:
- The staircase has at least 1 and at most 45 steps.
- 1 <= n <= 45

## Test Cases:

1. 
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: [1, 1], [2].

2. 
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: [1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1].

3. 
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 5
    Explanation: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2].

## Solution Explanation:

1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization (`climbStairsRec`):**
   This method uses recursion to solve the problem. It breaks the problem into two smaller problems: climbing `n-1` steps and `n-2` steps. Memoization ensures that results for previously calculated steps are stored and reused, avoiding redundant calculations.

2. **Iterative Dynamic Programming Approach (`climbStairsIterative`):**
    This method adopts a bottom-up approach, computing the solution iteratively. It utilizes the fact that the number of ways to get to step `i` is the sum of ways to get to steps `i-1` and `i-2`.

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the memory dictionary for memoization
        self.memory = {}

    def climbStairsRec(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Recursively calculates the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase 
        of n steps where each time one can either climb 1 or 2 steps.

        Args:
        - n (int): The number of steps in the staircase.

        Returns:
        - int: The number of distinct ways to climb the staircase.
        """
        
        # Base cases: If there's 1 or 2 steps, the number of ways is equal to n itself
        if n <= 2:
            return n

        # If the result for the current n is already computed, return it
        if n in self.memory:
            return self.memory[n]

        # Otherwise, compute the result and save it to memory
        self.memory[n] = self.climbStairsRec(n-1) + self.climbStairsRec(n-2)
        
        return self.memory[n]

    def climbStairsIterative(self, n: int) -> int:
        """

        of n steps where each time one can either climb 1 or 2 steps.

        Returns:

        # Initialize the list for dynamic programming
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Base cases: If there's 1 or 2 steps, the number of ways is equal to i itself
            if i <= 2:
                dp[i] = i
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        
        return dp[n]
```

## Complexity Analysis:

1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization:**
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    - **Space Complexity:** O(n)

2. **Iterative Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    - **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## Technical Follow-up Questions:

1. **How would the solution change if you could take 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time?**
    Answer: The recurrence would then be: `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2) + ways(n-3)`. We would have to adjust both the recursive and iterative solutions to account for the third option.

2. **If the function is called frequently, how can its efficiency be improved?**
    Answer: For frequent calls, using the iterative approach is more efficient due to its lower overhead compared to recursion. Moreover, storing results in a persistent cache could also boost response times for repeated inputs.

3. **How would you handle a scenario where some steps are "broken" and cannot be used?**
    Answer: We'd treat "broken" steps as steps that contribute 0 ways to the total. In the iterative solution, when computing ways for step `i`, if step `i` is broken, then `ways[i] = 0`.

## Real-world use cases:
1. **Accessibility Planning:** Understanding the different ways people can navigate steps helps in planning for accessibility.
2. **Game Development:** In platform games, where characters might have different abilities to jump or skip steps.
3. **Route Planning:** In scenarios where there are multiple small decisions (like steps) to reach a destination.
