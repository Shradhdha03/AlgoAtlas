**Article: Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists**

---

**Problem Statement:**
You are provided with the heads of two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`. The goal is to merge these two lists into a single sorted list. This merged list should be created by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. The function should return the head of the merged linked list.

**Constraints:**

1. The number of nodes in both `list1` and `list2` is in the range `[0, 50]`.
2. Each node's value (`Node.val`) is in the range `[-100, 100]`.
3. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in a non-decreasing order.

**Test Cases:**

1. **Test Case 1:**
    - Input: `list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]`
    - Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`
    
2. **Test Case 2:**
    - Input: `list1 = [], list2 = []`
    - Output: `[]`
    
3. **Test Case 3:**
    - Input: `list1 = [], list2 = [0]`
    - Output: `[0]`

**My Solution Explanation:**

The solution employs a classical linked list merging approach. Here are the steps:

1. Create a `dummy` node to serve as the starting point.
2. Utilize a pointer `prev` to keep track of the last node in the merged list.
3. Iterate over `l1` and `l2`:
    - If the current node of `l1` has a lesser or equal value compared to `l2`, link it to the merged list and move forward in `l1`.
    - Otherwise, link the current node of `l2` to the merged list and proceed in `l2`.
4. If one list is exhausted, link the remaining part of the other list directly to the merged list, leveraging the fact that the lists are already sorted.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)  # Using -1 as a dummy value, but it doesn't matter since it won't be part of the final list
        prev = dummy

        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val <= l2.val:
                prev.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                prev.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            prev = prev.next

        # At this point, one of the lists is exhausted, and the other still might have nodes. 
        # Since the lists are already sorted, we can simply link the remaining nodes.
        if l1:
            prev.next = l1
        else:
            prev.next = l2

        return dummy.next
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `list1` and `m` is the length of `list2`. This is because, in the worst case, we will have to iterate over all the nodes of both linked lists.

2. **Space Complexity:** O(1). The merging is done in place without allocating additional nodes. Only a constant space is used (like the `dummy` node and pointers).

**Technical Follow-up Questions (with answers):**

1. *How would you handle merging if the lists were exceptionally long, say on the order of billions of nodes?*
   - Answer: In such a scenario, we might need to employ external sorting or distributed processing techniques to handle the sheer size of data efficiently.

2. *How can you modify the code to work for doubly linked lists?*
   - Answer: For doubly-linked lists, we'd need to also manage the previous pointers for each node. While merging, we'd ensure that both `next` and `prev` pointers of nodes are correctly set.

3. *Can you adapt this method for merging more than two sorted lists at once?*
   - Answer: Yes, one approach is to use a min-heap or priority queue. We'd put the front node of each list into the heap. At each step, pop the smallest node, attach it to the merged list, and insert the next node from the same list into the heap.

**Real-world use cases:**

1. **Merging Sorted Files:** In scenarios where multiple sorted files (e.g., logs sorted by timestamps) need to be merged to create a comprehensive chronologically ordered file.

2. **Database Systems:** In database systems, merge algorithms are often used in operations like JOIN, which might need to merge sorted data from different tables.

3. **Real-time Data Processing:** When receiving real-time sorted streams from multiple sources, and there's a need to maintain a single, comprehensive, sorted stream.

**Powerful Questions:**

1. How would you handle the merging if the linked lists were sorted in non-increasing order?
   
2. What other data structures could be used to solve this problem, and how might they compare in terms of performance and simplicity?

3. How can you ensure that the merged linked list remains stable, i.e., if two nodes have equal values, the node from `list1` appears before the node from `list2`?
