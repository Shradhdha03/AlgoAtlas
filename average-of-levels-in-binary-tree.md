## **Average of Levels in Binary Tree**

### **Problem Statement**

Given a binary tree's root node, the task is to compute the average value of nodes present at each tree level. The result should be presented in the form of an array. The provided solution should be accurate within a tolerance of \(10^{-5}\).

### **Constraints**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range \([1, 10^4]\).
2. Node values range from \(-2^{31}\) to \(2^{31} - 1\).

### **Test Cases**

1. 
    - **Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
    - **Output:** `[3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]`

2. 
    - **Input:** `root = [3,9,20,15,7]`
    - **Output:** `[3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]`

### **My Solution Explanation**

The given solution uses a breadth-first traversal approach, often implemented with a queue. For each level, we traverse its nodes and compute the average value. The following steps detail the approach:

1. Start by initializing a queue with the root node of the tree.
2. Define a list `level_averages` to store the average values of nodes for each tree level.
3. For each tree level (until the queue is empty):
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level.
   - Initialize a new queue `next_level_queue` for the upcoming level.
   - Initialize a sum to store the total node values at the current level.
   - Traverse each node in the current level, update the sum, and add its children to `next_level_queue`.
   - Calculate the average value for the current level and append it to `level_averages`.
   - Set `queue` to `next_level_queue` for the next iteration.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def averageOfLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[float]:
        # Initialize the queue with the root node
        queue = [root]
        
        # This list will store the average of nodes at each level
        level_averages = []

        while queue:
            # Number of nodes at the current level
            level_size = len(queue)
            
            # Queue for the next level
            next_level_queue = []
            
            # Sum of node values at the current level
            level_sum = 0

            # Process all nodes in the current level
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.pop()
                level_sum += node.val

                # Add child nodes to the next level's queue
                if node.left:
                    next_level_queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    next_level_queue.append(node.right)

            # Calculate the average for the current level and add it to the results
            level_averages.append(level_sum / level_size)
            
            # Update the queue for the next iteration
            queue = next_level_queue

        return level_averages
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Each node is processed exactly once, making the overall time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - In the worst scenario (perfectly balanced tree), the maximum number of nodes stored in a queue will be at the last level. This will be roughly \(n/2\) nodes, leading to \(O(n)\) space complexity.

### **Technical Follow-up Questions**

1. **How can you optimize the solution if the tree is extremely large, making it impossible to fit in memory?**
   - *Answer:* One could employ an external sorting mechanism similar to level order traversal. We might save nodes at each level to the disk and read them sequentially, minimizing the in-memory footprint.

2. **If each node, in addition to its value, also held the average of its subtree (including itself), how would you modify the solution?**
   - *Answer:* In that case, a depth-first traversal approach could be used. You'd traverse to the deepest node while maintaining a level counter and update the averages without needing to traverse every node at each level separately.

3. **How would you handle cases where the binary tree is not balanced?**
   - *Answer:* The provided solution inherently supports both balanced and unbalanced trees, as it computes averages for each level regardless of the tree's balance.

### **Real-world use cases**

1. **Network Analysis:** In networks (e.g., computer networks, social networks), binary trees or tree-like structures can represent hierarchical connections. Averaging data at each level could provide insights like average bandwidth consumption per network layer or average user interactions per hierarchy in a social network.

2. **File Systems:** Hierarchical file systems can be visualized as trees. Computing average file/folder sizes, access frequencies, etc., at each depth level can provide insights into storage optimization.

3. **Organizational Structures:** Trees often represent organizational hierarchies. Averaging values like employee salaries, performance metrics, etc., at each level can guide decision-making processes.

### **Powerful Questions**

1. How would you adapt this solution for trees with nodes that have more than two children?
2. Can the solution be further optimized in terms of space complexity?
3. What other traversal methods can be applied to this problem, and how would they affect performance?
4. How would the approach differ if you needed the median instead of the average?
5. Could a similar approach be used for non-tree-based data structures, such as graphs? How would cycles be managed?
