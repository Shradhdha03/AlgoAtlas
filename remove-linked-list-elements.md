### **Article: Remove Linked List Elements**

---

#### **Problem Statement**:

Given the head of a linked list and an integer `val`, the objective is to remove all the nodes of the linked list that have `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

---

#### **Constraints**:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`

---

#### **Test Cases**:

1. **Example 1**:
   
   **Input**: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
   
   **Output**: [1,2,3,4,5]

2. **Example 2**:

   **Input**: head = [], val = 1
   
   **Output**: []

3. **Example 3**:

   **Input**: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
   
   **Output**: []

---

#### **My Solution Explanation**:

**Iterative Approach (`removeElements` method)**:
1. Create a dummy node to serve as a starting point before the actual head of the linked list. This helps in easily managing edge cases, especially when the head node itself needs to be removed.
2. Use two pointers, `prevNode` pointing to the previous node and `currentNode` pointing to the current node in the list.
3. Iterate through the linked list, checking each node's value.
   - If the current node's value is not equal to the given `val`, simply move the pointers forward.
   - Otherwise, bypass the current node by updating the `prevNode`'s next pointer and move `currentNode` to the next node.
4. The new head of the list is the next node of the dummy node.

**Recursive Approach (`removeElementsRec` method)**:
1. If the current node (head) is null, return null.
2. Recursively remove elements for the rest of the list.
3. If the current node's value is equal to `val`, return the result of the recursive call (which is the next node). Otherwise, set the next pointer of the current node to the result of the recursive call and return the current node.

```python
from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # 1. Create a dummy node as a placeholder to access the list head
        dummy = ListNode(0, head) 
        prevNode, currentNode = dummy, head 
        
        # 2. Iterate through the list till the end
        while currentNode:
            if currentNode.val != val: 
                # 3. If the current node does not match the value, move both pointers forward
                prevNode = currentNode
                currentNode = currentNode.next 
            else:
                # 4. If the current node matches the value, update the previous node's next pointer and skip the current node
                prevNode.next = currentNode.next
                currentNode = currentNode.next

        return dummy.next

    def removeElementsRec(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Base case: return None if the list is empty
        if not head:
            return None
        
        # Recursively call for the next node
        head.next = self.removeElementsRec(head.next, val)
        
        # Return the next node if current node matches the value, otherwise return the current node
        return head.next if head.val == val else head

#### **Complexity Analysis**:

**Iterative Approach**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - The linked list is traversed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Only a constant amount of space is used, irrespective of the size of the linked list.

**Recursive Approach**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Every node in the list is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, the stack can have all the nodes of the linked list.

#### **Technical Follow-up Questions with Answers**:

1. **How would you handle very large datasets?**
   
   *Answer*: For extremely large linked lists, the recursive approach might not be suitable due to potential stack overflow errors. The iterative approach is more scalable in this case.

2. **How can we optimize the space complexity?**

   *Answer*: The given solution's iterative method already has a space complexity of O(1). If further optimization is needed, we can look at other data structures or storage mechanisms.

3. **If there were additional requirements to also remove nodes based on certain patterns (e.g., every kth node), how would you adapt your solution?**

   *Answer*: We can include a counter in the iterative approach that keeps track of every kth node. If the counter reaches k, we remove the node and reset the counter.

#### **Real-world use cases**:

1. **Content Filters**: In content recommendation systems, certain content might be flagged or blacklisted. This problem can represent removing such blacklisted content from a user's feed.
2. **Spam Email Removal**: If an email system identifies certain emails as spam, they can be removed from the user's main inbox.
3. **Ad Blockers**: When certain ads or scripts match known ad signatures, they are removed from the webpage before being displayed to the user.
4. **Cleaning Data**: In data processing pipelines, sometimes certain data points or entries that match specific criteria need to be removed before processing.
5. **Database Cleanup**: Removing records from databases that match certain criteria or are flagged for deletion.
