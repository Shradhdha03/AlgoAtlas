### Article: Solving the Maximum Average Subarray Problem

#### Coding Problem: Maximum Average Subarray I

In the realm of coding challenges, one intriguing problem that often surfaces is finding the maximum average subarray. The problem can be stated as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
You are provided with an array `nums` of `n` integers, along with an integer `k`. The task is to find a contiguous subarray of length `k` that has the highest average value among all possible subarrays of that length and return this average value.

#### Constraints:
To correctly solve the problem, the following constraints must be considered:
1. `n`, which is the number of elements in `nums`, is equal to `nums.length`.
2. `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`.
3. Each element in `nums`, `nums[i]`, is an integer such that `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
    - Input: `nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]`, `k = 4`
    - Output: `12.75000`
    - Explanation: The subarray with maximum average is `[12, -5, -6, 50]`, with an average of `(12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 12.75`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
    - Input: `nums = [5]`, `k = 1`
    - Output: `5.00000`
    - Explanation: There is only one element, so the maximum average is the element itself, `5`.

#### My Solution Explanation:

The problem has been approached with two different methods in the provided solution:

1. **Brute Force Method (`findMaxAverageBruteForce`):**
   The brute force solution iterates through every possible subarray of length `k` and calculates the sum to find the maximum sum, which is then divided by `k` to get the average. 

2. **Optimized Method (`findMaxAverage`):**
   The optimized solution uses a sliding window approach. It keeps track of the sum of the last `k` elements, updating the maximum sum found as it iterates through the array. Once the window reaches the required size `k`, it starts to slide by adding the next element and subtracting the element that falls off the window, efficiently updating the current sum.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:

    def findMaxAverageBruteForce(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Brute force solution: check every subarray of length k
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:i+k])  # Use the built-in sum() for clarity
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum / k

    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Sliding window solution: keep track of the sum of the last k elements
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            current_sum += nums[i]
            if i >= k - 1:
                max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
                current_sum -= nums[i - k + 1]
        return max_sum / k

```

#### Complexity Analysis:

**Brute Force Method:**
- Time Complexity: `O(n*k)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`. For each of the `n-k+1` starting positions of a subarray, a sum of `k` elements is computed.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as only a fixed number of variables are used, independent of the input size.

**Optimized Method:**
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, as it involves a single pass through the array, with constant-time operations within the loop.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, similar to the brute force method, this approach only uses a few variables.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions:

1. How would you handle the problem if the array `nums` could not fit into memory?
2. If the input `nums` is a data stream, how would you maintain the maximum average of the last `k` elements as new elements come in?
3. What data structures would you use to handle updates and queries to the array in real-time?
4. How would your solution change if `k` can vary for multiple queries?

#### Real-world use cases:

- Analyzing the performance of stocks over a fixed number of days to determine the best window for investment.
- Processing sensor data to find periods of maximum average readings, which could indicate anomalies.
- In web analytics, determining the time frame with the highest average number of users or activities.

#### Powerful Questions:

1. How does the choice of algorithm affect the scalability of the solution to very large datasets?
2. In what ways can preprocessing the input array optimize the query time for multiple `k` values?
3. What are the trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity in this problem, and how do they manifest in real-world applications?
