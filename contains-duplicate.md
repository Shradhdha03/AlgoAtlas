### Contains Duplicate: A Common Coding Challenge

#### Problem Statement:

The problem "Contains Duplicate" is a simple yet frequent challenge encountered during technical interviews. Given an integer array called `nums`, the task is to determine if any integer value in the array appears more than once. If any such value is found, the function should return `true`. If all elements in the array are distinct, the function should return `false`.

#### Constraints:
1. The length of the array, `nums.length`, is at least 1 and at most 105.
2. The individual integers in the array, `nums[i]`, range from -109 to 109 inclusive.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
   **Output:** true
2. **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
   **Output:** false
3. **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
   **Output:** true

#### Solution Explanation:

The provided solution contains two methods to solve the problem:

1. **Sorting Approach (`containsDuplicate` method):** The idea here is to first sort the array, then simply iterate through the sorted array to check if any two consecutive elements are the same. If they are, then a duplicate has been found, and `true` is returned.

2. **Brute Force Approach (`containsDuplicateBruteForce` method):** This method takes a straightforward approach where each element in the array is compared with every other element. If a match is found, it means there's a duplicate, and the function returns `true`.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        """
        This method uses a sorting approach to determine if there are duplicates in the list.
        After sorting, it checks consecutive pairs for any duplicates.
        
        :param nums: List of integers.
        :return: True if duplicates exist, otherwise False.
        """
        
        # Sort the input list
        nums.sort()
        
        # Iterate over the sorted list
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # If a duplicate is found in consecutive pairs, return True
            if nums[i-1] == nums[i]:
                return True
                
        # If no duplicates are found, return False
        return False

    def containsDuplicateBruteForce(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        """
        This method uses a brute force approach by comparing each element with every other element 
        to determine if there are duplicates in the list.
        
        :param nums: List of integers.
        :return: True if duplicates exist, otherwise False.
        """
        
        n = len(nums)
        # Iterate over all the elements in the list
        for i in range(n):
            # For each element, compare with the rest of the elements
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    # If a duplicate is found, return True
                    return True
                    
        # If no duplicates are found, return False
        return False
```
#### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Sorting Approach (`containsDuplicate` method):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for the iteration = O(n log n) in total. Here, n is the number of elements in the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) if the sorting is done in-place.

2. **Brute Force Approach (`containsDuplicateBruteForce` method):**
   - **Time Complexity:** The outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs n times. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) as no extra space is used.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions:

1. **Handling Large Datasets:** How would you handle the situation if the input data was too large to fit in memory? Could you implement an external sorting method or utilize database techniques to solve the problem?

2. **Scalability:** If the function needs to be called frequently, how would you optimize it further? Would you consider preprocessing or caching mechanisms?

3. **Performance:** How would the performance vary if the input data had many repeating numbers versus mostly unique numbers? How would you account for worst-case scenarios?

4. **Parallel Processing:** Could you think of a way to leverage parallel processing or distributed systems to check for duplicates more efficiently?

5. **Data Structures:** Are there other data structures (e.g., Hash Sets, Bloom Filters) that might be more efficient for solving this problem? Why or why not?

6. **Edge Cases:** How would the solution handle the edge case where the input list is empty? What if the input list contains only one element?
