**Article on Counting Bits Problem**

---

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, we are required to return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (where 0 <= i <= n), `ans[i]` represents the number of `1's` in the binary representation of `i`.

### Constraints
- 0 <= n <= 10^5

## Test Cases

**Test Case 1:**
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]

**Test Case 2:**
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

## My Solution Explanation

The problem is essentially about counting the number of set bits for every integer from `0` to `n`. There are two primary methods provided for solving this problem:

### 1. Dynamic Programming Approach (`countBits` method):
This method leverages previously computed results to count bits more efficiently. It uses the fact that the bit count of an integer `x` is related to `x/2`. The offset keeps track of the next power of 2, and as we iterate over numbers, we can use the offset to retrieve previously counted results, hence counting bits in O(1) time for each number.

### 2. Brute Force Approach (`countBitsBruteForce` method):
For each number from `0` to `n`, this method manually counts the number of set bits. For each number, we repeatedly divide by 2 to examine each bit until the number becomes zero.

## Complexity Analysis

### 1. Dynamic Programming Approach:
**Time Complexity:** O(n) 
Each number is processed once, and for each number, bit counting is done in O(1) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
An array of size `n + 1` is used to store results.

### 2. Brute Force Approach:
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
For each number, in the worst case, we loop through all its bits. Hence for n numbers, time complexity becomes n multiplied by the average number of bits, leading to O(n log n).

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
An array of size `n + 1` is used to store results.

## Technical Follow-up Questions

1. **How would you handle extremely large values of `n` that exceed the memory limits?**
   - Answer: For extremely large values, one might consider using a generator in Python to yield results on-the-fly rather than storing them all in memory.

2. **How can you further optimize the dynamic programming approach to reduce space complexity?**
   - Answer: If only the final result is required and not intermediate states, we can use a rolling array technique where we use an array of fixed size to store only the most recent results.

3. **How would you parallelize the brute force solution for better performance on multi-core processors?**
   - Answer: The computation for each number is independent of others. Therefore, the problem is embarrassingly parallel. We can divide the range `0 to n` among multiple threads or processes and compute in parallel.

## Real-world use cases

1. **Digital Circuit Design:** The problem of counting bits is commonly encountered in digital circuit design, specifically in arithmetic circuits like adders where the number of set bits can determine certain behaviors.

2. **Image Processing:** In binary image processing, counting the number of set pixels (1's) in a binary image representation can be analogous to this problem.

3. **Network Protocols:** In certain error detection codes and network protocols, the number of set bits can be used to detect anomalies or errors.

4. **Compression Algorithms:** Many compression algorithms, especially those that operate on a binary level, utilize the frequency of set bits for optimal encoding.
