### Two Sum Coding Problem and Solutions

#### Problem Statement:
The "Two Sum" problem is a common challenge faced in software engineering and coding interviews. The task is straightforward: you are given an array of integers (`nums`) and another integer (`target`). Your goal is to find two distinct elements in the array that, when added together, equal the target value. The requirement is to return the indices of these two numbers.

#### Constraints:
- The array `nums` will have at least two elements, with a maximum of 10^4 elements.
- Each element in the array can be any integer between -10^9 and 10^9.
- The target value will also be in the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
- There is exactly one solution for each input set, and an element cannot be used twice.

#### Test Cases:
1. Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`  
   Output: `[0, 1]`

2. Input: `nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6`  
   Output: `[1, 2]`

3. Input: `nums = [3, 3], target = 6`  
   Output: `[0, 1]`

#### My Solution Explanation:
My solutions offer three different approaches to solve the "Two Sum" problem:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Iterate through each element `x` and search for `target - x` in the rest of the array. This is straightforward but can be inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Hash Map Approach**: Utilize a hash map to store the indices of the elements as they are iterated over. For each element, check if `target - current_element` is in the hash map. This is significantly faster because lookups in a hash map are on average O(1) time.

3. **Two Pointers Approach**: First, sort the array while keeping track of the original indices. Then, use two pointers to scan through the array from both ends, moving inward. This method assumes that the problem allows us to modify the original array, which typically does not hold for "Two Sum" problems.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

class TwoSumSolver:
    def find_two_sum_brute_force(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
        """
        Find two numbers that add up to target using brute force approach.

        :param nums: List of integers
        :param target: Target sum
        :return: List containing indices of the two numbers
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
        return None
    
    def find_two_sum_with_map(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
        """
        Find two numbers that add up to target using a hashmap to store visited numbers.

        :param nums: List of integers
        :param target: Target sum
        :return: List containing indices of the two numbers
        """
        num_to_index = {}
        for i, number in enumerate(nums):
            remaining = target - number
            if remaining in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[remaining], i]
            num_to_index[number] = i
        return None

    def find_two_sum_with_pointers(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
        """
        Find two numbers that add up to target using two pointers approach.
        This method assumes that nums is sorted and will return indices in the sorted array, 
        which does not conform to the problem statement if the indices from the original array are expected.

        :param nums: List of integers (assumed to be sorted)
        :param target: Target sum
        :return: List containing indices of the two numbers in the sorted array
        """
        nums_with_index = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            sum_ = nums_with_index[left][1] + nums_with_index[right][1]
            if sum_ == target:
                return [nums_with_index[left][0], nums_with_index[right][0]]
            elif sum_ > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
        return None
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is compared with every other element.
   - Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional space is required.

2. **Hash Map Approach**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n), because each element is visited once and hash map operations are O(1) on average.
   - Space Complexity: O(n), as we need to store up to `n` elements in the hash map.

3. **Two Pointers Approach**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the initial sorting of the array, and then O(n) for the two-pointer scan, resulting in O(n log n) overall.
   - Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the sorted array with the original indices.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions with Answers:

1. *How would you handle the "Two Sum" problem if the input array is extremely large and does not fit into memory?*  
   Answer: We could use external sort to sort the array on disk and then stream it into memory in chunks, applying the two pointers technique to each chunk.

2. *Can you optimize the space complexity of your solution if you have memory constraints?*  
   Answer: We can reduce the space complexity by using the hash map approach without storing all elements first. We populate the hash map while iterating, which handles memory constraints better.

3. *If the "Two Sum" operation is to be performed repeatedly on different target values for the same input array, how would you optimize it?*  
   Answer: Preprocess the array into a hash map with values as keys and their indices as values. This way, for each target sum computation, we can just query the hash map, resulting in O(1) time lookups for each query.

#### Real-world Use Cases:
- Finding if a system has a pair of processes whose combined memory usage reaches a critical threshold.
- Matching financial transactions that cancel each other out in accounting software.
- In e-commerce, pairing products to offer as a bundle where the total price hits a certain promotional target.

#### Powerful Questions:
1. *How would your approach change if you are allowed to use a particular element in the array more than once?*
2. *What if the "Two Sum" problem is extended to "Three Sum" or "Four Sum"? How does the complexity change and what would be your approach?*
3. *How would you test your "Two Sum" solution for correctness and performance?*
4. *What data structures could potentially improve the performance of the "Two Sum" solutions and under what conditions?*
