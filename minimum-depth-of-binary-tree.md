# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree - A Dive into Efficient Solutions

## Problem Statement

In the world of binary trees, a common challenge faced by software developers is determining the shortest path from the root of the tree to its nearest leaf node, which is known as the tree's minimum depth. The leaf node is characterized by the absence of child nodes. Solving this problem efficiently is critical in many applications, including those where binary trees are used to represent hierarchical data.

## Constraints

When addressing the problem of finding the minimum depth of a binary tree, the following constraints should be kept in mind:

- The number of nodes within the tree ranges from 0 to 105.
- Node values range from -1000 to 1000.

These constraints imply that the solution must be scalable and able to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Test Cases

To ensure the reliability and correctness of our solutions, we can construct the following test cases:

1. **Empty Tree:**
   - Input: `root = []`
   - Output: `0`

2. **Tree with Only Root Node:**
   - Input: `root = [1]`
   - Output: `1`

3. **Complete Binary Tree:**
   - Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
   - Output: `2`

4. **Skewed Tree:**
   - Input: `root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]`
   - Output: `5`

5. **Balanced Tree:**
   - Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,5]`
   - Output: `2`

## My Solution Explanation

The provided solution offers two approaches using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

### BFS Approach (`minDepthBFS`)

This method leverages the BFS strategy, which traverses the tree level by level. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level, incrementing the depth as it progresses. When it encounters a leaf node, it immediately returns the current depth, ensuring that the minimum depth is found as soon as possible.

### DFS Approach (`minDepthDFS`)

The DFS approach uses a stack to explore the tree. It maintains a variable `min_depth` to record the smallest depth encountered when reaching a leaf node. This method also includes a check to stop traversing a path if the current depth exceeds the known minimum depth, which is an optimization to avoid unnecessary computation.

### Recursive DFS (`minDepthDFSRec`)

The recursive solution defines a helper function `dfs` that calls itself to explore the depth of the tree. It uses the call stack implicitly, and by comparing the depths of the left and right subtrees, it finds the minimum depth.

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import Optional

# Assuming TreeNode is a class defined elsewhere that has 'left' and 'right' attributes
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


def minDepthBFS(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the minimum depth of a binary tree using BFS.
    
    :param root: TreeNode, the root of the binary tree
    :return: int, the minimum depth of the tree
    """
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque([root])
    level = 0
    
    while queue:
        level += 1
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return level
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
    
    return level


def minDepthDFS(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a stack with a tuple containing the node and its depth
    stack = [(root, 1)]
    min_depth = float('inf')  # Set the initial minimum depth to infinity

    while stack:
        node, depth = stack.pop()
        
        # Check if the current node is a leaf node
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            min_depth = min(min_depth, depth)  # Update the minimum depth
        
        # If the current depth is already greater than the known minimum,
        # there's no need to proceed further down this path.
        if depth >= min_depth:
            continue
        
        # If the node has children, add them to the stack with the incremented depth
        if node.right:
            stack.append((node.right, depth + 1))
        if node.left:
            stack.append((node.left, depth + 1))
    
    return min_depth

def minDepthDFSRec(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    # A helper function that takes a node and the depth of that node.
    def dfs(node, depth):
        if not node:
            return float('inf')  # If there's no node, return an "infinite" depth.
        
        # If it's a leaf node, return its depth.
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return depth

        # Recurse on the left and right children, incrementing the depth.
        left_depth = dfs(node.left, depth + 1)
        right_depth = dfs(node.right, depth + 1)
        
        # Return the minimum of the two depths.
        return min(left_depth, right_depth)

    # Start the DFS with the root node at depth 1.
    if not root:
        return 0  # If the tree is empty, the minimum depth is 0.
    return dfs(root, 1)
```

## Complexity Analysis

### BFS Solution

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might have to visit all nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the queue, which in the worst case might contain all nodes at the deepest level of the tree.

### DFS Iterative Solution

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), as in the worst case, we still might visit all nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the stack, which, in the worst-case scenario for a skewed tree, will contain all nodes.

### DFS Recursive Solution

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) for the call stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this will be O(N).

## Technical Follow-up Questions

1. How would you modify your solution if the tree cannot fit into memory?
2. Can your solution be adapted to a distributed system, and how would you handle communication between nodes?
3. What data structures would you use if you were to process the tree in parallel to minimize the overall computation time?
4. How would you test your solution for very large trees, and what metrics would you monitor?

## Real-world Use Cases

- **Web Crawling:** Determining the minimum depth could be analogous to finding the shortest click-path to a particular web page in a site's hierarchy.
- **Network Routing:** In network routing, finding the minimum depth can represent the shortest path to transmit data from one point to another.
- **Organizational Structure:** Finding the minimum depth in a tree representing an organizational structure can help in identifying the quickest decision-making path.
