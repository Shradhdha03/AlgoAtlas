[https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)


Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, the task is to return an array of the squares of each number, also sorted in non-decreasing order.

  Output: `[0, 1, 9, 16, 100]`

- Input: `[-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]`
  Output: `[4, 9, 9, 49, 121]`

- Input: `[0]`
  Output: `[0]`

- Input: `[-2, 2]`

- Input: `[2, 3, 4]`
  Output: `[4, 9, 16]`

## Solution Explanation:

The given solution implements two approaches: `sortedSquaresBruteForce` and `sortedSquares`.

### 1. Brute Force Approach:

In `sortedSquaresBruteForce`, we square each element of the input array and then sort the array. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

```python
def sortedSquaresBruteForce(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] *= nums[i]
    return sorted(nums)

def sortedSquaresBruteForce(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return squared numbers sorted using brute force."""
    return sorted([x**2 for x in nums])
```

### 2. Two Pointers Approach:

In `sortedSquares`, we use a two-pointer approach. We initialize two pointers, one at the start of the array (`left`) and one at the end of the array (`right`). We then compare the absolute values of the elements pointed to by `left` and `right`. The larger one is squared and placed at the end of the result array. We continue this process, moving the pointers inward, until we have processed all elements.

```python
def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]: 
    n = len(nums)
    sortedSquaredNums = [0] * n
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if abs(nums[left]) <= abs(nums[right]):
            sortedSquaredNums[i] = nums[right] ** 2
            right -= 1
        else:
            sortedSquaredNums[i] = nums[left] ** 2
            left += 1
    return sortedSquaredNums
```

## Complexity Analysis:

### sortedSquaresBruteForce:

- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we are modifying the input array in place (not considering the space required for the output array).

### sortedSquares:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), excluding the space required for the output array.

## Technical Follow-up Questions:

1. **Handling Very Large Datasets:** How would you modify the solution if the input array `nums` is too large to fit into memory? Can you think of an external sorting algorithm that could help in such scenarios?

    If the input array `nums` is too large to fit into memory, we can't load the entire array and process it in-memory. An approach to tackle this issue is to use External Sorting. External sorting is a class of algorithms used for dealing with massive quantities of data that do not fit into the computerâ€™s main memory. 

    For this specific problem, we could read the input array in chunks that fit into memory, square each number in the chunk, and write each chunk back to disk. After processing all chunks, we can use a k-way merge algorithm, similar to the one used in External Merge Sort, to merge these chunks in sorted order. The k-way merge algorithm selects the smallest element from the first elements of all chunks and writes it to the output, repeating this process until all chunks are empty.

2. **Scalability:** How well does the solution scale with increasing input size? Are there any performance optimizations that can make the solution more efficient for large inputs?

    The `sortedSquares` function using the two-pointer approach scales well with increasing input size, having a time complexity of O(n). However, when dealing with very large datasets, reading and writing chunks of data to and from the disk can become the bottleneck. Optimizing disk I/O by efficiently managing buffer sizes and minimizing the number of read and write operations could enhance performance for large inputs.

3. **Memory Usage:** How can we optimize the space used by the solution, especially when dealing with a large dataset? Is it possible to generate the output without using additional space?

    The space complexity of our optimized solution is O(n), primarily due to the additional list used to store the result. If dealing with a large dataset and memory is a concern, we can write the squared and sorted elements directly to an output file on disk, which would allow us to use constant additional memory.

4. **Parallel Processing:** Can the given problem be solved using parallel processing to improve performance? If so, describe how you would divide the work among different processing units.

    This problem can potentially benefit from parallel processing. The input array can be divided into smaller sub-arrays, each assigned to a separate processing unit. Each unit can independently square the elements and sort the sub-array in memory. Once all units have processed their sub-arrays, a final merge step (similar to the merge phase of a merge sort) can be performed to obtain the sorted array of squared elements.

5. **Edge Cases:** How does the solution handle edge cases, such as when all elements are zero or when the elements are extremely large or small? Does the solution remain efficient and correct in such scenarios?

    1. **All Elements are Zero**: The solution will correctly return an array of zeros, and it remains efficient as the operations are proportional to the number of elements.
    2. **Extremely Large or Small Elements**: The solution squares each element, so extremely large input values might result in overflow. In languages like Python, which have arbitrary-precision arithmetic, this is less of a concern, but it might be necessary to use a data type that can handle larger values in languages with fixed-precision arithmetic. For extremely small numbers, the solution remains efficient and correct as the squaring and sorting steps are unaffected by the actual values of the elements.
