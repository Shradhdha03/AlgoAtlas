### Article: Efficient Algorithms for Finding the Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

#### Problem Statement
The challenge is to find the kth smallest element in an n x n matrix, with each row and column sorted in ascending order. The key is to do this with better than O(n^2) memory complexity.

#### Constraints
- The matrix is square (n x n).
- 1 <= n <= 300.
- Elements range from -10^9 to 10^9.
- The matrix's rows and columns are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- 1 <= k <= n^2.

#### Test Cases
- Test Case 1:
  - Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
  - Output: 13
- Test Case 2:
  - Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
  - Output: -5
- Test Case 3:
  - Input: matrix = [[1,2],[1,3]], k = 2
  - Output: 1

#### My Solution Explanation
My solutions involve three distinct algorithms:

1. **Binary Search**: This method uses a binary search approach, where we find the mid-point value and count the elements less than or equal to this value in the matrix. The count helps us to decide whether to move left or right in our search space.

2. **Min-Heap**: We employ a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements. By pushing the first element of each row into the heap and extracting elements up to k times, we find our answer.

3. **Max-Heap**: We maintain a max-heap of size k, replacing the largest element with smaller ones from the matrix. The heap will eventually contain the k smallest elements, with the kth smallest at the root.

```python
class Solution:
    # Binary Search Method
    def kthSmallestBinarySearch(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)

        # Helper function to count elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to 'num'
        def countElemntsLessorEqual(num):
            count = 0
            col = n - 1

            # Loop over rows
            for row in range(n):
                # Move the column pointer left while elements are greater than 'num'
                while col >= 0 and matrix[row][col] > num:
                    col -= 1
                # Count includes all elements to the left of the column pointer
                count += (col + 1)
            return count

        # Binary search between the smallest and largest elements in the matrix
        left = matrix[0][0]
        right = matrix[n - 1][n - 1]
        ans = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # If count of elements less than or equal to 'mid' is at least 'k', 'mid' is a potential answer
            if countElemntsLessorEqual(mid) >= k:
                ans = mid
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return ans

    # Min-Heap Method
    def kthSmallestMinHeap(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        minHeap = []
        # Insert the first element of each row into the heap, do not exceed 'k' elements
        for i in range(min(k, n)):
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (matrix[i][0], i, 0))
        
        val = -1
        # Extract 'k' elements from the heap
        for i in range(k):
            val, r, c = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            # If there's a right neighbor, add it to the heap
            if c + 1 < n:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (matrix[r][c + 1], r, c + 1))
        return val

    # Max-Heap Method
    def kthSmallestmaxHeap(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        heap = []
        n = len(matrix)
        count = 0
        # Iterate over each element in the matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                # Keep a max-heap of the 'k' smallest elements seen so far
                if count < k:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, -matrix[i][j])
                    count += 1
                else:
                    # If current element is smaller than the largest in the heap, replace it
                    if matrix[i][j] < -heap[0]:
                        heapq.heappop(heap)
                        heapq.heappush(heap, -matrix[i][j])
                    # Since rows and columns are sorted, no need to check further elements in this row
                    else:
                        break
        return -heap[0]
```
#### Complexity Analysis
- **Binary Search Method**: The time complexity is O(n * log(max-min)), where max is the largest and min is the smallest element in the matrix. This is because we perform a binary search and, for each mid-value, we run a linear pass over the matrix rows. Space complexity is O(1) since we only use variables for counting.

- **Min-Heap Method**: The time complexity is O(k * log(min(k, n))) because we perform k extractions, and each heappush or heappop operation takes O(log(min(k, n))) time. Space complexity is O(min(k, n)) for storing the heap elements.

- **Max-Heap Method**: Time complexity is O(n^2 * log(k)) in the worst case, as we might insert into the heap for every element in the matrix, and each heappush or heappop operation takes O(log(k)) time. The space complexity is O(k) due to the heap.
