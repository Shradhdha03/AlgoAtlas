### Article: Exploring Binary Tree Paths

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, serving as the foundation for many algorithms and applications. In this article, we delve into a common problem involving binary trees, analyze two distinct solutions, and explore their implications in real-world scenarios.

#### Problem Statement
The "Binary Tree Paths" problem is straightforward yet essential for understanding binary tree traversal. Given the root of a binary tree, our task is to find all the unique paths from the root to the leaves, where a leaf is defined as a node with no children. The paths should be represented as strings, with each node's value concatenated and separated by "->".

#### Constraints
The constraints help us understand the problem's bounds and guide the solution design:

- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100, providing a finite and manageable size for traversal.
- Node values range from -100 to 100, which affects the memory footprint due to the size of the integers.

#### Test Cases
To verify the correctness of our solutions, we can define several test cases:

1. **Basic Test Case**: A tree with a single node (root = [1]). Expected output: ["1"].
2. **Simple Tree**: A tree with three nodes, where the root has two children (root = [1,2,3]). Expected output: ["1->2", "1->3"].
3. **Unbalanced Tree**: A tree where one branch is deeper (root = [1,2,3,null,5]). Expected output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"].
4. **Full Tree**: A tree where every node has two children and the tree is complete.
5. **Large Tree**: A tree with the maximum number of nodes (100 nodes) to test the performance limits.

#### My Solution Explanation
The provided code includes two methods to solve the problem:

- `binaryTreePaths`: A recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach that traverses the tree, building paths as it goes along and collecting them when it reaches a leaf node.
- `binaryTreePathsIterative`: An iterative approach that mimics the call stack of recursion using an explicit stack data structure.

Both methods use a helper function `construct_path` to create the path strings, ensuring that the code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

```python
from typing import Optional, List

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        if not root:
            return []

        def construct_path(node: TreeNode, path: str) -> str:
            return f"{path}->{node.val}" if path else str(node.val)

        def dfs(node: TreeNode, path: str, paths: List[str]):
            if node:
                path = construct_path(node, path)
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    paths.append(path)
                else:
                    dfs(node.left, path, paths)
                    dfs(node.right, path, paths)

        paths = []
        dfs(root, "", paths)
        return paths

    def binaryTreePathsIterative(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        if not root:
            return []

        stack = [(root, "")]
        paths = []
        while stack:
            node, path = stack.pop()
            path = construct_path(node, path)

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                paths.append(path)
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, path))
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, path))
        return paths

# Helper function used by both methods
def construct_path(node: TreeNode, path: str) -> str:
    return f"{path}->{node.val}" if path else str(node.val)

```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Recursive Solution**:
  - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
  - Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the call stack during recursion. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the space complexity could be O(N).

- **Iterative Solution**:
  - Time Complexity: O(N), similar to the recursive solution since each node is visited once.
  - Space Complexity: O(N), because, in the worst-case scenario, the stack could hold all nodes if the tree is completely unbalanced.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions
1. How would your solution scale with very large datasets, potentially larger than memory?
2. Can your solution handle updates to the tree structure in real-time?
3. What would you change if the problem required bidirectional traversal?
4. How would you modify your approach if the tree nodes contained references to their parents?
5. Is your solution optimized for concurrent executions?
