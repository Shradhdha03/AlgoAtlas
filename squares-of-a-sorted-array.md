## Article: Squares of a Sorted Array â€“ An Efficient Approach

### Problem Statement
In the coding problem "Squares of a Sorted Array," we are given an array of integers `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order. The challenge is to return an array of the squares of each number, also sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Constraints
- The length of the array `nums` is between 1 and 10^4.
- Each element in `nums` is an integer ranging from -10^4 to 10^4.
- The array `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Test Cases
Consider the following test cases to validate the solutions:
```plaintext
Test Case 1:
Input: nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]

Test Case 2:
Input: nums = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]
Output: [4, 9, 9, 49, 121]

Test Case 3:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Test Case 4:
Input: nums = [-5, -4, -2, -1]
Output: [1, 4, 16, 25]

Test Case 5:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### My Solution Explanation
I present two solutions in my code. The first uses a brute force approach, which involves squaring each element and then sorting the resulting list. This method does not leverage the sorted property of the input.

The second solution is optimized and makes use of a two-pointer technique. Since the input array is already sorted, the largest squares will either be at the beginning or the end of the list. The two-pointer approach works by comparing the absolute values of the numbers at both ends of the array and placing the larger square at the end of the result array, working backwards.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sorted_squares_brute_force(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Calculate the square of each element and return the sorted list of squares.
        This brute force method does not take advantage of the sorted property of the input.
        """
        squares = [num * num for num in nums]
        squares.sort()  # Inefficient: O(n log n) due to sorting
        return squares

    def sorted_squares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Calculate the sorted list of squares efficiently using two pointers.
        This method utilizes the fact that the input list is sorted.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        result = [0] * n
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        for index in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if abs(nums[left]) > abs(nums[right]):
                result[index] = nums[left] ** 2
                left += 1
            else:
                result[index] = nums[right] ** 2
                right -= 1
        return result

```

### Complexity Analysis
**Brute Force Method:**
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step after squaring all the elements.
- Space Complexity: O(n) to hold the result, assuming the sort is not in-place.

**Optimized Method:**
- Time Complexity: O(n), as each element is looked at once and the result array is filled out in one pass.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the result array. No additional space is used, hence it's more space-efficient than the brute force.

### Technical Follow-up Questions with Answers
- **How would your solution scale with very large datasets?**
  The optimized solution would scale well with large datasets, as it only requires a single pass through the data. However, it assumes that the entire array can fit into memory. For extremely large datasets that do not fit into memory, an external sort or a streaming approach would be necessary.
  
- **Can your solution be parallelized?**
  The two-pointer technique is inherently sequential since it relies on the sorted nature of the array. Parallelization could be possible in the squaring step, but the merging of results would need a careful approach to maintain order.

- **What if the input array is too large to fit into memory?**
  If the array cannot fit into memory, a disk-based merge sort could be used to handle the input in chunks. Alternatively, a distributed computing model could be used to process parts of the array in parallel on multiple machines.

### Real-world Use Cases
This problem is analogous to many real-world scenarios, such as:
- **Signal Processing:** Squaring and sorting frequency magnitudes in signal processing for noise reduction.
- **Data Analysis:** Ordering data points that have been transformed by a quadratic function.
- **Graphics Rendering:** Adjusting pixel values following a non-linear transformation.

### Powerful Questions
1. **How can the algorithm be adapted to handle streaming data?**
2. **What modifications would be needed to maintain efficiency if the input array could contain extremely large numbers?**
3. **How would you handle the case where the input array is not entirely sorted?**
4. **Could there be a more space-efficient solution if the result can overwrite the input array?**
5. **How might you prove the correctness of your solution?**
6. **What data structures could be leveraged to improve the brute force method?**
