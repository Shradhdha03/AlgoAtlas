# Article on "Range Sum Query - Immutable"

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you are tasked with handling multiple queries to calculate the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` (both inclusive) where `left` <= `right`.

You must implement the `NumArray` class which should provide:

- A constructor that initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
- A method `sumRange` that returns the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
- 0 <= left <= right < nums.length
- At most 10^4 calls will be made to `sumRange`.

## Test Cases

Let's consider some of the test cases to understand the problem:

```python
# Initializing the array
numArray = NumArray([-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1])

# Test Case 1:
assert numArray.sumRange(0, 2) == 1  # (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1

# Test Case 2:
assert numArray.sumRange(2, 5) == -1  # 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1

# Test Case 3:
assert numArray.sumRange(0, 5) == -3  # (-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -3
```

## My Solution Explanation

We provided two different solutions:

1. **Prefix Sum Approach (`NumArray` class):**  
    - We first calculate the prefix sum for each index. 
    - To calculate the sum of a given range, we subtract the prefix sum of the start index from the prefix sum of the end index.
    - This allows us to retrieve the sum of any range in O(1) time.
   
2. **Iterative Approach (`NumArray1` class):**
    - We simply iterate over the range [left, right] and sum the elements.
    - This leads to an O(n) time complexity for each query.


```python
from typing import List

class NumArray:
    """
    This class uses a prefix sum approach to compute the sum of a range in O(1) time.
    """
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sums = [0]
        
        # Compute the prefix sums for the given nums
        for num in nums:
            self.prefix_sums.append(self.prefix_sums[-1] + num)

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        """
        Computes the sum of the numbers in the range [left, right] inclusive.
        """
        # Use the precomputed prefix sums to compute the sum in O(1) time.
        # Subtract the sum up to 'left' from the sum up to 'right'.
        return self.prefix_sums[right + 1] - self.prefix_sums[left]

class NumArray1:
    """
    This class computes the sum of a range in O(n) time by iterating through the range.
    """
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        """
        Computes the sum of the numbers in the range [left, right] inclusive.
        """
        return sum(self.nums[left:right+1])

# Example usage:
# obj = NumArray(nums)
# result = obj.sumRange(left, right)

```

## Complexity Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Approach (`NumArray` class):**  
    - **Time Complexity:**
        - Initialization: O(n) - We traverse through the array once to calculate prefix sums.
        - `sumRange` Query: O(1) - Because of the pre-computed prefix sums.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(n) - For storing prefix sums.
   
2. **Iterative Approach (`NumArray1` class):** 
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n) for each `sumRange` query, where `n` is the distance between `left` and `right`.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - No additional space other than the input array.

## Technical Follow-up Questions

1. **How would you handle very large datasets that cannot fit into memory?**
    - Answer: One could use external memory data structures or databases optimized for range queries. Solutions like distributed databases or file systems could be used to shard data across multiple nodes and process queries in parallel.

2. **How can you optimize the range sum for mutable arrays where values can change over time?**
    - Answer: A segment tree or a Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree) could be used. They allow for both range sum calculations and point updates in logarithmic time.

3. **What if you have to handle real-time updates and queries simultaneously in a multi-threaded environment?**
    - Answer: One could use data structures with locks, or more advanced, lock-free data structures to handle concurrency. Ensuring thread-safety while keeping performance in mind would be crucial.

## Real-world use cases:

1. **Financial Applications:** Computing the cumulative return over a range of dates for a given stock or asset.
2. **Databases:** Range queries are often required in databases, for example, to calculate the sum of sales between two dates.
3. **E-commerce:** To compute the total sales of a product over a specified period.
4. **Analytics Software:** Many analytics tools require range sum features to provide insights over a specified period.
