### Article: Solving the Maximum Product Subarray Problem

The **Maximum Product Subarray** problem is a common coding challenge that is often used to test a candidate's understanding of dynamic programming and array manipulation. It requires finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest product.

#### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to find a subarray that yields the largest product and return that product. The subarray must contain at least one number and the entire array is considered a subarray of itself.

#### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer.

These constraints imply that an efficient algorithm is necessary for arrays at the upper limit of size, and special attention must be given to the handling of negative numbers, which can affect the product significantly.

#### Test Cases
Consider the following scenarios to test the functionality of the solution:

1. A basic case with positive numbers: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]` should return `24`.
2. A case with a negative number that could be excluded: `nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]` should return `6`.
3. A case with zeros and negative numbers: `nums = [-2, 0, -1]` should return `0`.
4. A case with all negative numbers: `nums = [-2, -3, -4]` should return `12`.
5. An edge case with a single number: `nums = [0]` should return `0`.

#### My Solution Explanation
The provided code includes two methods:

- `maxProductBruteForce`: A brute force approach that checks every possible subarray, calculating their products, and keeping track of the maximum. This method is straightforward but not efficient for large arrays due to its \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.

- `maxProduct`: An optimized approach using dynamic programming that achieves \(O(n)\) time complexity. It keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step because a new negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum.

```python
class Solution:

    # Brute force method to find the maximum product subarray
    def maxProductBruteForce(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize the maximum product to negative infinity
        # to handle cases where all numbers are negative
        maxProd = float('-inf')
        
        # Iterate over the array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Initialize the product to 1 before starting the inner loop
            prod = 1
            # Iterate over the subarray starting at i
            for j in range(i, len(nums)):
                # Multiply the current number to the product
                prod *= nums[j]
                # Update the maximum product found so far
                maxProd = max(prod, maxProd)
        # Return the maximum product found
        return maxProd

    # Optimized method to find the maximum product subarray using dynamic programming
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize the max product, min product (for handling negative numbers),
        # and the answer to the first number in the array
        maxProd, minProd, ans = nums[0], nums[0], nums[0]
        
        # Iterate over the array starting from the second element
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # Calculate the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number
            # and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number
            # and the previous minimum product
            x = max(nums[i], maxProd * nums[i], minProd * nums[i])
            # Calculate the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number
            # and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number
            # and the previous minimum product
            y = min(nums[i], maxProd * nums[i], minProd * nums[i])
            
            # There's a typo here 'c' should not be here, this will cause a syntax error
            # Update the maximum and minimum products
            maxProd, minProd = x, y
            # Update the answer with the maximum product found so far
            ans = max(maxProd, ans)
        
        # Return the maximum product subarray found
        return ans

```
#### Complexity Analysis
- **Brute Force Method**: 
  - Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the length of the array. This is because it checks every possible subarray.
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), no additional space is used proportional to the input size.

- **Optimized Method**:
  - Time Complexity: \(O(n)\), the array is traversed only once.
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), as only a constant number of variables are used.

#### Technical Follow-up Questions
1. How would you modify your solution to handle arrays that cannot fit into memory?
2. If the input array is streamed, how would you process it for the maximum product?
3. Can your solution be parallelized? If so, how?
4. How does the presence of zeros or negative numbers affect the performance of your algorithm?
